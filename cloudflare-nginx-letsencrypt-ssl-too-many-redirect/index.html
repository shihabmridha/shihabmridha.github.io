Too many redirect issue. (Silly mistake)</h1><div class=meta>Posted at &mdash; Oct 31, 2019</div></div><div class=markdown><p>I know you are familiar with Cloudflare, Nginx, and Letsencrypt. In case you didn&rsquo;t know, <strong>Cloudflare</strong> does a lot of things including DNS management, DDoS protection, free SSL, caching and a lot more. <strong>Nginx</strong> is one of the most popular HTTP server / reverse proxy/load balancer and <strong>Letsencrypt</strong> let you install SSL in your server.</p><p>I am a fan of all these three technologies. I use Cloudflare a lot because why not? It is giving me protection from DDoS, free SSL, etc for free. When I was planing for creating this blog, the first cms came to my mind is WordPress. It&rsquo;s free, easy to maintain, tons of plugins to do stuff and cheap. But, WordPress was not the only cms that were in my mind. I already know about Ghost and I have a very soft corner for it since it is written in NodeJS. NodeJS and Nginx scales and performs better than WordPress and Apache. I could use Nginx with WordPress but ehh. Finally, I decided to use Ghost.</p><p>Bought this domain, set Cloudflare&rsquo;s DNS, created an EC2 Ubuntu 18.04 instance, installed all the necessary stuff and then followed Ghost&rsquo;s official installation instruction. I skipped the SSL part because I decided to use Cloudflare&rsquo;s SSL although I know very little about Cloudflare&rsquo;s SSL feature. All I knew was I enable it from Cloudflare&rsquo;s dashboard and I am good to go. In reality, it was that easy as well. But, I was facing a problem with Ghost. When I tried to add an item to the navigation menu, Ghost forcefully changing the URL from HTTPS to HTTP. I get it. Ghost doesn&rsquo;t know that I am using HTTPS. So, I decided to switch off Cloudflare&rsquo;s SSL and install SSL on my server. This is where I messed things up. <strong>I should not have switched off Cloudflare&rsquo;s SSL.</strong> There were a couple of options: <strong><em>Off, Flexible, Full, Full (Strict).</em></strong> Go to their website to know more about these options. Initially, I was using <strong>Flexible</strong> then switched to <strong>Off</strong>.</p><p>Ghost provides handy CLI to install SSL and it uses Letsencrypt. Since I was using Cloudflare&rsquo;s DNS, when I hit my website using HTTPS it goes to Cloudflare and Cloudflare redirect it to HTTP since I switched SSL off. Cloudflare redirects to my server using HTTP but my Nginx config redirects every request to HTTPS. It was creating a redirection cycle like the following steps.</p><ol><li>Browser (Input HTTPS url to address bar).</li><li>Cloudflare DNS resolver. Cloudflare redirects to HTTP (Since SSL is off!).</li><li>My Server. My server redirect to HTTPS</li><li>Step 2 again.</li></ol><p>I was like what the hell. What is happening? I kept modifying my Nginx configuration in many ways but could not make it work. Searched for the issue. I have found a lot of answers but honestly, I didn&rsquo;t realize that they are the same victim as mine. I thought mine was different.</p><p>After wasting two to three hours I have found a command to trace my request. Then I have found the cycle between my server and Cloudflare. I went to Cloudflare&rsquo;s dashboard and found my fault. Changed my SSL configuration from <strong>Off</strong> to <strong>Full.</strong> Then, it started to work as expected.</p><p>I never wasted that much time setting up an SSL certificate, EVER!</p><blockquote><p>Little knowledge is a dangerous thing.</p></blockquote></div><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/nginx>Nginx</a></li><li><a href=/tags/cloudflare>Cloudflare</a></li><li><a href=/tags/letsencrypt>Letsencrypt</a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div>Â© Another Dev | <a href=https://github.com/vividvilla/ezhil>Ezhil theme</a> | Built with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></div></nav></div><script>feather.replace()</script></body></html>
