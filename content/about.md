Hi, I am a software engineer with more than three years of experience under my belt.

I have mostly used NodeJS with TypeScript and MongoDB as database but I am not bound to it. In last few years I have used a lot of technologies. A short list is below:

**Languages:** C#, Java, TypeScript, PHP, Bash, Python, Golang,

**IDE/Tools:** VS Code, Visual Studio, PHP Storm

**Frameworks/Technologies:** Docker, Git, Elasticsearch, NodeJS, Laravel, WebSocket, React, React Native etc.

**Databases:** MongoDB, MySQL, MS SQL, PostgreSQL, Redis

Nowadays I am learning system design, golang, c# and aws. Also, focusing on building/writing scalable products.

Currently working for [Toptal](https://toptal.com).
