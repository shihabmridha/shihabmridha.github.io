Hi, I am a software engineer with more than five years of experience under my belt. I have mostly used NodeJS with TypeScript and MongoDB as database but I am not bound to it. In last few years I have used a lot of technologies. A short list is below:

**Languages:** C#, TypeScript, Golang, PHP, Python, Bash

**IDE/Tools:** VS Code, Visual Studio, Dbeaver, Bruno, Docker, Git

**Frameworks/Technologies:** NodeJS, .NET Core, Laravel, Elasticsearch, WebSocket, React Native

**Databases:** MongoDB, MySQL, MS SQL, PostgreSQL, Snowflake, Redis

Nowadays I am learning machine learning, math, golang, system design, religion and philosophy.
